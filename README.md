# ImageProcessing
In this project, we will understand how a machine reads and processes image for machine learning models. 
We will look into the underlying data structure of an image, packages used in python for image processing, 
convert the images into numpy arrays, split the dataset into train and test and 
end this part of the series by converting the datasets into tensors for deep learningÂ models.
